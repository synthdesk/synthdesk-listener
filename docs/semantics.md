## semantics and scope

all outputs are descriptive epistemic records.
they do not encode recommendations, priorities, timing, magnitude, or intent.

any downstream use must introduce its own independent decision logic.

### forbidden vocabulary

verbs:
recommend, decide, choose, select, route, optimize, act, trigger, execute,
enter, exit, buy, sell, scale, size, increase, reduce, avoid, pursue

nouns:
signal, strategy, trade, position, order, risk, pnl, profit, loss,
edge, alpha, opportunity, setup

### approved substitutes

- signal → annotation / indicator
- strength → confidence / certainty
- trigger → condition observed
- decision → classification
- optimize → characterize
- action → state transition (descriptive only)
- priority → salience (non-ordered)
- ranking → unordered set

this document exists to prevent advisory or execution semantics
from entering observational systems.
